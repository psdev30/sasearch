# SASearch
SASearch is a clip searcher of the popular sports personality Stephen A. Smith's (SAS) best reactions

## Installation
Just go to https://sasearch3011.web.app

## Why I made it
Tbh, it's pretty much useless—but if you know anything about Stephen A. Smith, it's that he's hilarious, flamboyant, & a meme machine, so opportunities frequently arise in which I could respond to someone w/ a SAS meme or short clip. Unfortuantely, the SAS folder on my phone is much too large at this point, so it's kinda hard to find what I'm looking for without some serious scrolling 

## Usage
- The "I'm Feeling Lucky" button works similarly to Google's—clicking it displays a random video 
- Unless you're a SAS superfan or frequent NBA Twitter, you probably don't have much of a clue about what you could look up, so here are some example searches:

## How it works

## Code Snippets

## What's in the works
- Making it Android compatible (\*technically* it works on Android, but it looks terrible and still requires the use of a browser, so making a mobile version will be better) 
- Figuring out buildpack/compatibility issues w/ Selenium + Chrome Webdriver not working on Heroku (so I can add clips automatically instead of manually having to add each one)

## What I want to do after that
- Add a more advanced caching mechanism
    * right now it has local caching, but as soon as you reload the page the cache clears

## Complaints
If you have any issues w/ SAS---well, I'll just let him show you how I feel
